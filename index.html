    <p><i>In the frantic aftermath of college graduation, Sean and Sara were two hopeful kids selected as interns by the US Army All American Bowl. Fifteen recent graduates from all over the country were grouped into teams of three expected to hop in a van, drive around the country, and put on countless events for the top high school football players (& band members) of the USA. Only a romantic comedy could have picked the sweetest, small town boy from Iowa to be grouped with the loud, relentless girl from New Jersey, but here they are. Nothing makes a relationship serious like living out of a van together for a few too many months.
        Not too long after deciding the van life was not for them, Sean took the plunge, moving to New Jersey. Sara assured him of amazing housing accommodations upon his arrival. Little did Sean know this meant moving in with Sara’s parents and putting their relationship to the test once again. 
        Isn’t this how every couple has to start out their relationship? No? Oh, well they should. Makes them a lot stronger. 
        Anyway, we slowly became adults, navigating our careers and moving into our first apartment in Summit, NJ. They learned a lot quickly and faced highs and lows together. After about three years, they knew they were meant to be, and wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. After that discussion, Sara mentally prepared and Sean waited six months to propose, in classic Midwest style. It was worth the wait. 
        Sean popped the question while they were visiting his family for Christmas in Iowa & Kansas City. It was a perfect day, except for in the morning when Sara accused Sean of ignoring her, but it all made sense later on. For future reference, nerves make Sean a mute, fair warning for our wedding day. 
        It was about a month after the proposal Sara accepted a graduate position at Whittier College in California. Before they knew it, they were packing up their lives and driving across the country. Now settled, Sean is working as a City Coordinator and Sara is the Sports Information Graduate Assistant. Life has seemed nonstop and Sara highly advises against planning a wedding while working towards a Master’s Degree. But they wouldn't change anything about their story. 
        They have been so blessed with the amazing family and friends surrounding them through this journey. They cannot wait to spend the rest of their lives together and celebrate with all of you on June 11th, 2022!
